#Getting Started
1. App from angular.io tutorial part 1
2. Initial build with StackBlitz
3. Skipped to deploy to move to local environment
## Steps to build in local environment
1. install angular cli -- npm install -g @angular/cli
2. ng new \<project name>\
3. cd <project name>
4 replace src folder from stackblitz in project
5. ng serve 
## note to run project due to version change from doc and dismiss error by polyfill
1. In package.json copy dependecies from stackblitz and replace in project
2. ng serve will run w/o error as version is now compatible
