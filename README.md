please note due to changes in version of angular to properly compile and run
1. replace src folder with project src
2. in package.json ---> cut dependecies and replace in project

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
